Bayou Sno Co. is a Louisiana-style snoball trailer dedicated to sharing the unmistakable flavor and joy of a true New Orleans tradition. Serving finely shaved ice drenched in bold, vibrant syrups, we bring a refreshing taste of the bayou wherever we go—one snoball at a time.

As a proud venture of Bayou Mountain Holdings, LLC, Bayou Sno Co. embodies the company’s mission to blend creativity, culture, and community into every experience. While our roots reach into the heart of Louisiana, our spirit is shaped by the same balance of precision and passion that defines all Bayou Mountain ventures.

Born from the love of southern tradition and the desire to spread a little sweetness beyond state lines, Bayou Sno Co. is more than a trailer—it’s a celebration on wheels. Whether it’s a local event, neighborhood stop, or summer afternoon treat, we’re here to serve smiles, spark memories, and share the simple joy of a perfectly made snoball.

At Bayou Sno Co., life’s best moments are cool, colorful, and meant to be savored.
